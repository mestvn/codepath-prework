## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [X] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

The biggest challenge I encountered in creating this submission was starting the project itself. For the most part, I had school and work almost 15-20 hours a week until this past week of Spring Break. Then, there was the dreadful "This shouldn't take too long. I'll just start it tomorrow!" that kept hitting until I just sat myself down and started working on it. Personally, I like to understand what I'd be getting into, so I had to read through the whole page first and mentally prepare myself for how I was going to tackle this project. I overcame this problem of hesitating to start by just throwing myself out there and trying my best to follow the instructions to the fullest. With my past history on HTML and CSS, most of the project was freshening up on these skills while trying to comprehend the JavaScript that tied everything together. So, I ended up using the instruction sheet as more of a progress checker and guide rather than mindlessly copying all of the directions given. Otherwise, this project was not too challenging.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

After completing my submission, I have learned that there must be a lot more going on behind the scenes of bigger websites. Although this project took a few hours with a couple hundred lines of code, I am very curious on how working on a bigger project with multiple people would be like! More specifically, I really enjoyed the JavaScript portion where I got to make the website more interactive such as adding the game aspect of it and would really love to learn more about how one can get started creating website projects like https://bruno-simon.com/ where the whole website is an open world or a big name company such as Meta and their interactive https://about.facebook.com/meta/

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would most definitely attempt to complete all of the optional features. Of course, it can be said that most "optional" suggestions are not really "optional", but I would be doing myself a favor as well by challenging my skills and seeing how well I can implement the easier and harder features. Specifically, I have a background in music and I only got to making a segment of "Jingle Bells", so one feature to implement would be incorporating at least 20 seconds worth of a song. Not only would there be more buttons with frequencies mapped to other notes, but there would be another array that contains the note-length for each note. That way, although the tune would be a lot longer to get through, the user could hopefully recognize the song and be able to better associate the notes with the buttons. In the grand scale of "picking a different pattern each time the game is played," I would add a whole array of popular songs, each in their own keys and note-lengths mapped to the buttons.
